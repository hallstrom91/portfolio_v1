      "description": "I was born and raised in Piteå, Norrbotten County. Since 2016, I have been living in Stockholm and am currently deepening my skills as a Frontend Developer specializing in web security at Jensen Higher Vocational Education in Kista. Belonging to the FWK23S class, I am expected to complete my education by the summer of 2025. My lifelong interest in computers has been a driving force that is now guiding me towards a career in an area that I find extremely fascinating and interesting. I am seeking an internship starting from the fall of 2024 for a period of six months to further enhance my skills and gain practical experience.",

      "description": "During my ongoing education, I have absorbed several new programming languages and frameworks. To deepen my skills and strive for excellence in my field, I have engaged in self-studies to master additional frameworks in my free time. Although formally studying to become a Frontend Developer, I have discovered a particular passion for Backend development with Node.js. This insight has broadened my technical horizon and contributes to a versatile skill profile. Thriving in both the worlds of Frontend and Backend strengthens my ability to create integrated and efficient solutions in web development."
