      "description": "During my ongoing education, I have absorbed several new programming languages and frameworks. To deepen my skills and strive for excellence in my field, I have engaged in self-studies to master additional frameworks in my free time. Although formally studying to become a Frontend Developer, I have discovered a particular passion for Backend development with Node.js. This insight has broadened my technical horizon and contributes to a versatile skill profile. Thriving in both the worlds of Frontend and Backend strengthens my ability to create integrated and efficient solutions in web development."
